    <p>Wilkie Collins</p>
    <p>Wilkie Collins was born on January 8, 1824 in Marleybone, London. He died on September 23, 1889 at age 65 of a stroke.
      Today, he is best known for The Moonstone (1868), often regarded as the first true detective novel. During his life
      time, Collins adapted an addiction to opium which started to impact his writing. He even made the comment that he was
      on opium when he was writing The Mooonstone, and when he finished writing, he didn't even recognize his own work.</p>
